          First things first. Fuck 2020.<br><br>It has been a year we wonâ€™t
          forget. <br><br>But also one of reflection. <br><br>For some,
          it has exposed fallacies in business that have been ingrained by many
          as inherent truths. For the longest time we have valued figures above
          people. <br><br>We must do better. <br><br>Not a number was
          created by a group of young digital entrepreneurs in the summer of
          2020 with the purpose of supplying good work to good people with
          honesty and sincerity. <br><br>We love to collaborate with
          likeminded start ups and established businesses to make them stand out
          rather than fit in.
