          First things first. Fuck 2020.<br><br>
          It has been a year we wonâ€™t forget.<br><br>
          But also one of reflection.<br><br>
          For some, it has exposed fallacies in business that have been ingrained by many as inherent truths. For the longest time, we have valued figures above people.<br><br>
          We must do better.<br><br>
          Not a number was created by a group of young digital entrepreneurs in the summer of 2020 to supply good work to good people with honesty and sincerity.<br><br>
          We love to collaborate with like-minded start-ups and established businesses to make them stand out rather than fit in.
